### Home Assistant Sungrow SHx integration
Sungrow SH Integration for Home Assistant for SH3.6RS, SH4.6RS, SH5.0RS, SH5.0RT, SH6.0RS, SH8.0RT, SH6.0RT, SH10RT

Tested with a **Sungrow SH10.RT** Inverter and a **PylonTech Force H1 battery**, **Home Assistant 2021.11**.

**!!! Some users reported that Sungrow ships several inverters with the new WiNetS Adapter, which does currently not support Modbus TCP**

Sungrow promised in several forums, that a software update for enabling Modbus is under development, but no ETAs left

The Modbus register mapping is based on two documents, the Sungrow support sent me by eMail. I am not sure, if I am allowed to share the files, but maybe you can successfully search for them...

# Usage

## Overview 
I use the Visual Studio Code Server add-on for configuration. In the screenshot the relevant files for the sungrow integration are highlighted:

##  Configuration in secrets.yaml
The yaml-based integration file needs 3 parameters as input. Copy the following lines in your secrets.yaml and adapt them:

    sungrow_modbus_host_ip: 192.168.178.20 # TODO update with the IP of your inverter. No default. Check your router.
    sungrow_modbus_port: 502 # TODO update with the Modbus port of your inverter. Default is '502'
    sungrow_modbus_slave: 1 #TODO update with the slave address of your inverter. Default is '1'

##  Modbus register mapping
The file **modbus_sungrow.yaml** contains the Modbus register maps. Copy the file  to a subfolder named "integrations", which is located at the same level of your "configurations.yaml". 

Include "modbus_sungrow.yaml" by adding follwing lines to your "configuration.yaml":

    homeassistant:
      packages: !include_dir_named integrations
    
Do not forget to check your configuration and restart.


##  Add a nice "Energy Dashboard" like shown above
1. Create a new dashboard (or use the standard one)
2. Click "Add new Card" and select "Entities"
3a. Add the sensor values you want to display. I (more or less randomly) divided them into momentary power, energy, battery and other.
3b. (Alternative to 3a): Copy [this dashboard file]](https://github.com/mkaiser/Sungrow-SHx-Inverter-Modbus-Home-Assistant/files/7848160/Sungrow_Dashboard.yaml.txt) and copy it a new dashboard using the "raw configuration editor" (top right, the 3 dots). Ensure that the spacing keeps intact (Apparently github does not support the .yaml file extension :/ )



##  Configure the HomeAssistant energy dashboard

Open the Energy settings ("Configuration" --> "Energy") and adapt the highlighted values as shown in the screenshot:

Note, that only the energy values in kWh are shown in this dashboard and not the current power dissipation (in W).



# Status and future work 
I only included the most important registers, which seem to be common between a wide range of Sungrow inverter models . There are many more registers in the Sungrow documents, which I left out. 

Please let me know, if the integration works also with other Sungrow SHx models. 
The manual also mentiones following Sungrow inverters, it may also work. Leave me a feedback on this models!
